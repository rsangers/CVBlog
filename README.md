# Elastic deformation invariance in medical imaging

In the field of medical imaging, acquiring training data is in general costly, especially for rare conditions. It is therefore important to use available data in an efficient way when training a model. Existing methods often apply data augmentation, such as image translation, to increase the amount of data. More recent literature is focussed on unsupervised learning techniques to increase model accuracy without the need of labelling data. In this project, we have applied a siamese neural network [1] to learn elastic deformation invariance on medical data, with the goal of thereby increasing the prediction accuracy for image classification.
